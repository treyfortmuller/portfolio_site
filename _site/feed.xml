&lt;p&gt;Something about wanting to get into wings, why are delta wings cool. I’ll break this build into several parts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image main&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/wing/intro/1_first_build.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is Flite Test Arrow (I think), took this thing and despite my best efforts of scowering YouTube for how to have a successful maiden flight I crashed it and destroyed the pod. No electronics took any damage. The differing flight dynamics experienced by the pilot between multirotors and fixed wings. Took the undamaged wings off and capaitalized on an oppurtunity to be creative with the next build&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image right&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/tool-stand/1_inspiration.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UC Berkeley’s Jacobs Institute for Design Innovation is the campus’s largest maker space and houses all sorts of advanced fabrication equipment. The staff there is well-versed in building and maintain a state of the art maker space and they’ve come up with some novel solutions to make your build process as seamless as possible. The sleek solution for storing and accessing hand tools is shown to the right. At my workspace in my apartment I’m always digging through my tool box for the particular set of pliers I need, so as a weekend project I decided to make my own version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;design&quot;&gt;Design&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image right&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/tool-stand/2_tools_pic.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started with the tools I thought I accessed most and arranged them on the floor of my apartment until I found an aesthetically pleasing and space efficient configuration. I’ve got my wire strippers, digital calipers, some super glue, an X-acto knife, all the necessities for desktop projects in robotics. I simply took an overhead shot of all the tools in place and threw the image into Fusion 360 as a canvas. I scaled the image in CAD based on a measurement of the length of the screw driver and began tracing each tool with rectangles and splines. Then I simply outlined each curve with a few millimeters of margin and added semicircles as grabbing points. I traced an outer rectangle and arrived at my cut geometry. For thoroughness I extruded the geometry into 3D and added the backing layer. I also designed two kick stands to glue onto the back so that the tools rest at a comfortable 45 degree angle on my desk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image main&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/tool-stand/3_CAD.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tool stand is constructed from a piece of 0.5” thick plywood (this makes up the main tool geometry and kick stands) and a piece of 0.25” plywood (for the back face of the stand where the tools rest). Jacobs Hall stocks plywood of various specifications and sells it all at cost to students as long as you’re not buying in bulk. I purchased my plywood for a few dollars and brought my exported DXF geometry from CAD to the laser cutter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;build&quot;&gt;Build&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Universal Laser Systems cutters at Jacobs use Adobe Illustrator as a preprocessor analogous to a slicer for a 3D printer or a CAM tool for a CNC mill. This process is intuitive, and as long as the lens is clean, the large cutter I used for this job cuts through 0.5” plywood cleanly. I engraved lines in the backing piece of the tool stand to be sure I would glue the kick stands on in the right position.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image main&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/tool-stand/5_laser.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I liberally applied some wood glue and C-clamped all the pieces together. After the wood glue dried a day later, I brought the build home and test-fit my tools. The stand works great and keeps my workbench clean and efficient. The magic of CNC strikes again to bring a project from conception to completion in only a few hours of work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image main&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/tool-stand/6_components.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the cleaned-up components of the stand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took this course in the Fall of 2017, my junior year. When I took it, it was a new class, the first time it had been offered at Berkeley, as well as the first ever class taught by a new faculty member Mark Mueller. I recognized Professor Mueller from ETH Zurich’s Institute for Dynamic Systems and Control, the birthplace of the PX4 project and online videos like &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CR5y8qZf0Y&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;. I hadn’t taken any of the prerequisites for the class, but decided to go for it anyway. A number of UAVs@Berkeley personnel would be accompanying me and I assumed I could make up for a lack of prerequisite classes with my somewhat obsessive love for working on drones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image right&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/cf-flight-controls/cf2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The class started with a seven week long deep dive into the dynamics of multirotors in the fully abstract tensor formalism. We started with aerodynamic models for propellers and ended with a mixer matrix, the basis for our attitude controller. While the lecture of the course focused on theory and analysis in dynamics, estimation, and control, the lab section focused on implementing a hover controller from scratch. The class was split into groups of 3 or 4 and each group was given a &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bitcraze.io/crazyflie-2/&quot;&gt;Crazyflie&lt;/a&gt; quadcopter to implement their controller.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Crazyflie is a tiny brushed quadcopter powered by a 1S LiPo. It has an STM32F4 microcontroller running &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.nuttx.org/&quot;&gt;NuttX&lt;/a&gt;. The PCB that the microcontroller sits on doubles as a rigid frame for the quadcopter. The hardware (mostly the motors) leave something to be desired, but the firmware interface was easy to work with. The class was given an Ubuntu virtual machine’s disk image to run in VirtualBox which had all the required dependencies installed. In the virtual machine, we compiled and flashed our custom firmware (all written in C++) to the board using the Eclipse IDE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final lab of the semester was a flight competition. Each group was pitted against each other to see who built the best performing controller. Long story short, we won, but more on that later. My lab group’s controller is available on &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/treyfortmuller/ME136&quot;&gt;my GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;box&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
  	This course introduces students to the control of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The course will cover modeling and dynamics of aerial vehicles, and common control strategies. Laboratory exercises allow students to apply knowledge on a real system, by programming a microcontroller to control a UAV.

&lt;h2 id=&quot;full-system-block-diagram&quot;&gt;Full System Block Diagram&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the entire quadcopter controller represented in a block diagram as provided by our professor. Red ellipses represent hardware, shaded triangles represent simple summations and multiplications, and rectangles represent system parametrization and dynamics, or estimation and control algorithms we built up in lab sections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image main&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/cf-flight-controls/block_diagram.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;parameterizing-the-system&quot;&gt;Parameterizing the System&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We started the lab section of the class by finding some scaling factors for the physical system empirically. Ultimately, we needed the transformation from the PWM command we could dictate as an output of our control, to the thrust produced the motor. The thrust produced at each motor creates a moment about the vehicle’s center of mass and contributes to the total normalized thrust. We find this transformation in two steps:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;motor-pwm-to-propeller-angular-velocity&quot;&gt;Motor PWM to Propeller Angular Velocity&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We needed to know how PWM commands from the flight controller to the motors affect the angular velocity of the propellers. We took a photo laser &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Digital-Photo-Laser-Tachometer-Contact/dp/B001N4QY66/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1514604195&amp;amp;sr=8-1-spons&amp;amp;keywords=tachometer&amp;amp;psc=1&quot;&gt;tachometer&lt;/a&gt; and measured the propeller RPMs at various PWM commands and derived a linear relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;propeller-angular-velocity-to-thrust&quot;&gt;Propeller Angular Velocity to Thrust&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The class didn’t have any thrust stands available, so the GSIs got creative and gave each team a lever made from laser cut acrylic that the Crazyflie could be fastened to with M2 screws. The lever was fixed to the edge of a table with tape. We commanded various propeller angular velocities (using our new PWM to angular velocity relationship) and logged the accelerometer data to find the average angle that the quadcopter arrived at. Then we solved the statics problem embodied by the free body diagram to determine the thrust force that each propeller was producing. We derived a quadratic relationship here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image main&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/cf-flight-controls/cf_lever.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;state-estimation&quot;&gt;State Estimation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;attitude-estimator&quot;&gt;Attitude Estimator&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The attitude estimator obtains the orientation of the quadcopter (pitch, roll, yaw) in the body frame of the vehicle. It uses the sensor data from the IMU (a rate gyroscope and an accelerometer). We parametrized the rotations (a frighteningly rich topic that I was not aware of before taking this class) of the vehicle using Euler angles. I recognize that this choice makes us look like we’ve learned nothing from &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gimbal_lock#On_Apollo_11&quot;&gt;Apollo 11&lt;/a&gt;. We implemented rotations using Euler angles because they are intuitive and easy to visualize, but they do suffer from singularities (gimbal lock, wrist flip, etc. depending on who you talk to), and some computational slowness. This was acceptable since we were looking to control about a hover, if our quadcopter passed through 90 degrees in pitch, something bad happened. Quaternions of rotation (not the hypercomplex ‘Quaternions’), are the best choice for rotation parametrization because they do not suffer from singularities and are not computationally intensive. Quaternion parametrization was introduced at the end of the class, and redoing our entire attitude estimator using quaternions in the week before the class competition seemed unwise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s the estimator as it was originally designed in lab, notice we use a trade-off factor &lt;code&gt;p = 0.01&lt;/code&gt; so we heavily favor the gyroscope, but supplement it with the accelerometer data to prevent drift.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;//***Gyro + accelerometer attitude estimator***
estRoll = (1.0f-p)*(estRoll + dt*rateGyro_corr.x) + p*(in.imuMeasurement.accelerometer.y / gravity);
estPitch = (1.0f-p)*(estPitch + dt*rateGyro_corr.y) + p*(in.imuMeasurement.accelerometer.x / -gravity);
estYaw = estYaw + dt*rateGyro_corr.z;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In preparation for the final competition we decided to eliminate the small angle approximations, sacrificing ease of computation for a more accurate estimator. It improved performance and stability in some scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;// ***Gyro + accelerometer attitude estimator + no small angle approximations***
AngVel.x = rateGyro_corr.x + rateGyro_corr.y*(sinf(estRoll)*tanf(estPitch)) + rateGyro_corr.z*(cosf(estRoll)*tanf(estPitch));
AngVel.y = rateGyro_corr.y*cosf(estRoll) - rateGyro_corr.z*sinf(estRoll);
AngVel.z = rateGyro_corr.y*((sinf(estRoll))/(cosf(estPitch))) + rateGyro_corr.z*((cosf(estRoll))/(cosf(estPitch)));

// beware accelerometer and gyro measurements on different axis can reflect the same motion
estRoll = (1.0f-p)*(estRoll + dt*AngVel.x) + p*(asinf( in.imuMeasurement.accelerometer.y / (gravity*cosf(estPitch))));
estPitch = (1.0f-p)*(estPitch + dt*AngVel.y) + p*(asinf( in.imuMeasurement.accelerometer.x / -gravity));
estYaw = estYaw + dt*AngVel.z;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;height-estimator&quot;&gt;Height Estimator&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The height estimator relies only on a range sensor below the quadcopter. This is a noisy sensor, so we’ve implemented some checks to throw out bad data. It’s also a slow sensor so it doesn’t update at every call to our main loop. The one subtlety in working with this sensor is that a change in pitch or roll angle will cause the detected distance to the ground to change. We account for this in &lt;code&gt;hMeas&lt;/code&gt;, and mix this value with &lt;code&gt;estHieght&lt;/code&gt; which updates with an estimated velocity based on the height deltas between successive calls to the main loop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;// height estimator:
// prediction step:
estHeight = estHeight + estVelocity_3 * dt;

// correction step, directly after the prediction step:
float const mixHeight = 0.3f;
if (in.heightSensor.updated) {

	// check that the measurement is reasonable
	if (in.heightSensor.value &amp;lt; 2.0f) {
		float hMeas = in.heightSensor.value * cosf(estRoll) * cosf(estPitch);
		estHeight = (1 - mixHeight) * estHeight + mixHeight * hMeas;

		float v3Meas = (hMeas - lastHeightMeas_meas) / (in.currentTime - lastHeightMeas_time);

		estVelocity_3 = (1- mixHeight) * estVelocity_3 + mixHeight * v3Meas;
		// store this measurement for the next velocity update
		lastHeightMeas_meas = hMeas;
		lastHeightMeas_time = in.currentTime;
	}
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;horizontal-estimator&quot;&gt;Horizontal Estimator&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The horizontal estimator is very similar to the height estimator in that we must account for pitch and roll changes past some small angle. We augment the optical flow sensor outputs &lt;code&gt;sigma_1, sigma_2&lt;/code&gt; with rate gyro data in pitch and roll. Note here that optical flow only gives us information on horizontal velocity (hence “flow”) so we’ve got to integrate to get an estimated position.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;float const mixHorizVel = 0.5f;
if (in.opticalFlowSensor.updated) {
	float sigma_1 = -in.opticalFlowSensor.value_x;
	float sigma_2 = -in.opticalFlowSensor.value_y;

	float div = (cosf(estRoll) * cosf(estPitch));

	if (div &amp;gt; 0.5f) {
		float deltaPredict = estHeight / div;

		float v1Meas = (-sigma_1 + in.imuMeasurement.rateGyro.y) * deltaPredict;
		float v2Meas = (-sigma_2 - in.imuMeasurement.rateGyro.x) * deltaPredict;

		estVelocity_1 = (1.0f - mixHorizVel) * estVelocity_1 + mixHorizVel * v1Meas;
		estVelocity_2 = (1.0f - mixHorizVel) * estVelocity_2 + mixHorizVel * v2Meas;
	}
}

estPos_1 = estPos_1 + (dt * estVelocity_1);
estPos_2 = estPos_2 + (dt * estVelocity_2);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;controller&quot;&gt;Controller&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image left&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/cf-flight-controls/cf1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I struggle with how to talk about the controller on my website in just a few paragraphs. I feel like I’d have to write a few thousand words to offer any more insight than the source code alone can provide. If staring at the source code interests you, then by all means &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/treyfortmuller/ME136/blob/master/UserCode.cpp&quot;&gt;check it out&lt;/a&gt;. Basically, the controller takes our state estimation to be truth and controls around a flat, zero-velocity state for the quadcopter, i.e. hovering at about half a meter off the ground. The approach is cascaded (so rate control is more aggressive than angle control for example) and time constants are chosen so that nested controllers at each stage can be considered instantaneous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;flight-competition&quot;&gt;Flight Competition&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last lab section of the course was a hovering contest among the 20 or so lab groups. A net was set up in the middle of the room, enclosing a 6ft by 8ft rectangular prism, about 8ft high. You could place your quadcopter on the ground anywhere inside the netting but then you had to pass your XBox controller off to a GSI who would press the red button to start your main loop and begin your autonomous hover (hopefully). Each team was given 8 minutes to run as many flights as possible, the longest flight wins! Our actual lab grade depended on how we ranked against the other teams, so the stakes were high. There was one catch: after 90 seconds of flight, one of the GSIs would turn on a fan inside the netting to destabilize the controller or blow the quad into a net.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My team (David, Joey, and I) was the only team to reach 90 seconds of flight and have the fan turn on. On our longest run we achieved 105 seconds of flight before crashing into the net, withstanding the fan for 15 seconds. We were excited, I wish I had video of the event, but we had pulled an all-nighter before the competition tuning and perfecting the controller and it slipped my barely functional mind at the time. There were many modifications we made to the stock controller which allowed us to achieve this performance. We eliminated small angle approximations from our estimators and controllers, we implemented position control as well as an &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absement&quot;&gt;absition&lt;/a&gt; feedforward (the integral of position is called “absition” or “absement,” it’s a thing). We added height setpoint scheduling for a smooth takeoff as well as hard-coded gain scheduling on the attitude controller. These changes, along with fine tuning our time constants through many hours of flight tests, allowed us to stay in the air for longer than we expected. &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://kittyhawk.aero/&quot;&gt;Kitty Hawk&lt;/a&gt; ended up sponsoring the competition with a DJI Spark drone for each member of the winning team. Here we are on zero hours of sleep, but very gratified. Left to right Professor Mueller, David, Joey, and yours truly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ME136 was a challenge but cemented my interest in controls. Of all the all-nighters I’ve pulled, the one before this class competition was one of the most worthwhile.&lt;/p&gt;</content><summary type="html">A cascaded controller implementation for autonomous loitering with a Crazyflie quadcopter.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="/images/cf-flight-controls/cf_main.jpg" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Photogrammetry 3D Scanner</title><link href="/blog/3d-scanner/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Photogrammetry 3D Scanner" /><published>2017-10-08T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2017-10-08T00:00:00-07:00</updated><id>/blog/3d-scanner</id><content type="html" xml:base="/blog/3d-scanner/">&lt;p&gt;I built this project with my friends Suneel and Nathan for UC Berkeley’s hackathon: &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://calhacks.io/&quot;&gt;Cal Hacks&lt;/a&gt;, one of the largest collegiate hackathons in the world.

We plan to continue improving your project and move it past its initial stage so you can continue adding onto it, while receiving the same support from a hackathon.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
	This includes: One-on-one director mentorship, Work with industry professionals and venture capitalists, Receive support from The House Founders program, Gain access to future hack nights and unlimited amount of free resources.

&lt;p&gt;We were given $1000 to continue building our project out as far as we’d like. Suneel, Nathan, and I have plenty of ideas as to how to best use this money to turn our weekend project into a useful tool. Our original Cal Hacks submission for the project can be found on &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://devpost.com/software/greg-wt609e&quot;&gt;DevPost&lt;/a&gt;. Also, the directors of Cal Hacks wrote &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://medium.com/cal-hacks/the-cal-hacks-fellowship-transcending-beyond-the-hack-468a84a9db06&quot;&gt;a Medium article&lt;/a&gt; about the motivation behind the Cal Hacks Fellowship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;inspiration&quot;&gt;Inspiration&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3D Printing offers quick and easy access to a physical design from a digitized mesh file. Transferring a physical model back into a digitized mesh is much less accessible in a desktop platform. We sought to create our own desktop 3D scanner that could generate high fidelity, colored and textured meshes for 3D printing or including models in computer graphics. The build is named after our good friend Greg who let us borrow his stereo camera for the weekend, enabling this project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-build&quot;&gt;The Build&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image left&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/3d-scanner/greg10.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rig uses a ZED stereo camera driven by a ROS wrapper to take stereo images at various known poses in a spiral which is executed with precision by two stepper motors driving a leadscrew elevator and a turn table for the model to be scanned. We designed the entire build in a high detail CAD using Autodesk Fusion 360, 3D printed L-brackets and mounting hardware to secure the stepper motors to the T-slot aluminum frame we cut at the metal shop at Jacobs Hall. There are also 1/8th inch wood pieces that were laser cut at Jacobs, including the turn table itself. We designed the power system around an Arduino microcontroller and an Adafruit motor shield to drive the steppers. The Arduino and the ZED camera are controlled by python over a serial port and a ROS wrapper respectively to automate the process of capturing the images used as an input to OpenMVG/MVS to compute dense point clouds and eventually refined meshes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image main&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/3d-scanner/greg_cad.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;challenges&quot;&gt;Challenges&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image right&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/3d-scanner/greg11.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We ran into a few minor mechanical design issues that were unforeseen in the CAD, luckily we had access to a 3D printer throughout the entire weekend and were able to iterate quickly on the tolerancing of some problematic parts. Issues with the AccelStepper library for Arduino used to simultaneously control the velocity and acceleration of 2 stepper motors slowed us down early Sunday evening and we had to extensively read the online documentation to accomplish the control tasks we needed to. Lastly, the complex 3D geometry of our rig (specifically rotation and transformation matrices of the cameras in our defined world coordinate frame) slowed us down and we believe may still problematic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;future-improvements&quot;&gt;Future Improvements&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re proud of the mechanical design and fabrication, actuator precision, and data collection automation we achieved in just 36 hours. The outputted point clouds and meshes are still being improved. This is a result of the ZED stereo camera we used, it wasn’t the right camera for the job as it is optimized for depth sensing up to 20m away, not 20cm away as in our build. It did however have an awesome advantage in that we could control it through ROS, so automating the activation of the camera through a python script was easy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image main&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/3d-scanner/greg_build.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the money we won at the hackathon, we are planning on purchasing an Nvidia TX2, to integrate all the automation and mesh construction onto an embedded platform that can be carried with the scanner. Also, we’ll purchase an XBox Kinect camera and try to rebuild around using IR depth sensing rather than photogrammetry. This method has been proven specifically for this close-range application and we’re hoping to generate our first usable mesh during the Spring 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I go to school in Berkeley, CA. The campus is built on a hill, so it’s difficult to get from point A to point B if point B is East of point A. Electric vehicles are, of course, the future of personal transportation, but I’m on a budget so a Tesla isn’t an option. In fact, even a $1,400 Boosted Board is a little pricey. I decided to build my own electric longboard to get around the Berkeley hills, I wanted all the torque I could muster whilst keeping the cost down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;drivetrain-specification&quot;&gt;Drivetrain Specification&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I knew I wanted to use two 4S LiPos in series to run my powertrain on 8S power because I can still use 4S batteries for other projects (flying drones, field charging other LiPos, etc.). With 8S voltage decided, what KV motor should I buy and what gear reduction should take place between the motor and the wheels?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the hills being hard to conquer, the pavement in Berkeley is treacherous. Big wheels make clearing gaps and cracks in the asphalt easier and the largest, easily found longboard wheels are 90mm in diameter. I do value my physical safety, so I decided on a top speed of 20mph. Upon doing some research, I found gear reductions on electric longboards to be anywhere from 1.8 to 2.5, I went with a 3:1 gear reduction to optimize for torque rather than top speed. We do some math to find the required motor KV:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image main&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/e-board/motor_math.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best brushless outrunner motor candidate I could find was &lt;a target=&quot;\_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://hobbyking.com/en_us/turnigy-aerodrive-sk3-6374-192kv-brushless-outrunner-motor.html?wrh_pdp=2&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; 192KV Turnigy from HobbyKing. It’s got some convenient mounting holes and the stator is tall rather than wide, so it should fit nicely under the deck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;design&quot;&gt;Design&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-board&quot;&gt;The Board&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image main&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/e-board/render1.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I designed the deck itself from scratch. This was an awesome excuse to get my hands dirty with a piece of fabrication equipment I had not gotten to interact with so far, the ShopBot CNC Router. This is an 8-foot by 6-foot behemoth of a CNC machine available to me in Jacobs Hall on campus at UC Berkeley. I modeled the splines of the deck after other off the shelf designs I had seen for longboards. I purchased an 8-foot by 6-foot piece of 3/4inch plywood for the project (it cost me $16) and was able to cut five decks out of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My design features a divot in the underside of the deck for low profile mounting of electronics, inset mounting for the trucks, and a filleted underside edge. It took 8 hours to cut all 5 decks using 4 tool changes on the ShopBot. This was also my first experiencing generating gcode for the ShopBot in Autodesk Fusion 360’s CAM workspace. The tool path simulations and automatic collision/interference warnings were super useful, and prevented me from destroying a CNC machine worth (much) more than my car. Here’s the tool paths outlined in Fusion:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image main&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/e-board/board_fab1.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image main&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/e-board/board_fab2.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image main&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/e-board/shopbot.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image right&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/e-board/cover.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I designed and printed some covers which wrap over the divot in four pieces to protect the electronics bay from moisture or gravel. They’re prototyped now out of PLA and are meant to be attached simply with M3 flathead screws. I’m brainstorming now how I might fabricate a mechanism to more easily remove and reattach them when I need to access the bay to charge batteries. The final products will be printed out of Nylon for durability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Longboards are typically made from bamboo, maple, birch, or composite materials. I made mine from a low-grade plywood without paying much attention to the load carrying capacity of my design. Upon hopping on for the first time, I felt an uneasy sinking at the center of the board under my weight rather than the springy feel of manufactured boards. I compensated with an aluminum beam spanning the electronics bay and it felt much safer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image main&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/e-board/board1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I sourced a few off the shelf parts from &lt;a target=&quot;\_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://diyelectricskateboard.com/&quot;&gt;DIY Electric Skateboard&lt;/a&gt; for gears, pulleys, and a motor mount. This simplified the build, but I still had to modify my rear trucks meticulously with a file to mount the motor properly. Using the cast aluminum parts for the critical drivetrain components probably boosts my safety rating a bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image main&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/e-board/motors.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image main&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/e-board/transmit1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mechanical design for the hand held remote is underway now. I’ve got to fit an Arduino Nano, a 9V battery, an nRF24 transceiver module, a dead man’s switch, and potentiometer for throttle control inside an ergonomic 3D printed case. I’ve got the electronics finished and code ready to be tested.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More to come after I complete this project.&lt;/p&gt;</content><summary type="html">IN PROGRESS: An electric longboard with a handheld wireless controller.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="/images/e-board/board_main.jpg" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Midair Hotswap</title><link href="/blog/hotswap/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Midair Hotswap" /><published>2017-06-15T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2017-06-15T00:00:00-07:00</updated><id>/blog/hotswap</id><content type="html" xml:base="/blog/hotswap/">&lt;h2 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Midair Hotswap is a project I did within the UAVs@Berkeley student organization campus at Cal which I now lead as President. I began this project at the start of my Sophomore year as a Team Lead. We started with about 12 people and over the course of the 3 semesters we worked on this project, we ended up with a team of 5 dedicated undergraduate engineering students who stuck it out till the bitter end. This project was incredibly rewarding to work on. Not only did my technical knowledge, prototyping intuition, and design methodology strengthen over the course of the 3 semesters, my understanding of how to work in a team grew enormously. From simple face to face communication on technical topics, to delegating tasks that play to the strengths of each team member, to maintaining a unified vision, and even keeping my team motivated and inspired to pursue this project, I couldn’t have asked for a better platform to grow as a future professional engineer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;motivation&quot;&gt;Motivation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response to growing popularity in UAVs, drone manufacturers and developers are increasingly putting efforts into improving the performance and capabilities of their products. One of the most important metrics for multirotor performance is flight time, how long the vehicle can stay in the air before its battery depletes. The longest flight time among consumer UAVs only reach up to half an hour. Researchers across the globe are seeking to improve battery chemistries and UAV flight efficiency. The Midair Hotswap project approaches this problem from another angle, replacing the battery of a drone with a new one, without touching the ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;project-description&quot;&gt;Project Description&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Midair Hotswap consists of two UAVs. One larger hexacopter and a smaller quadcopter. The small quadcopter lands on top of the larger hexacopter while both are hovering the air. Mechatronics on board the landing platform which rests on top of the hexacopter then swap out the battery of the quadcopter. The quadcopter can then take off again with a fully charged battery, having never landed on the ground to get its battery replaced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image main&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/hotswap/full.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;subsystems&quot;&gt;Subsystems&lt;/h3&gt;

				&lt;td nowrap=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Quadcopter&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
				&lt;td&gt;The target of our battery swap. Runs the Betaflight firmware on a Naze32 flight controller. 3D printed cones secure to the motor mounts and the battery slides into the underside of drone.&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;/tr&gt;
			&lt;tr&gt;
				&lt;td nowrap=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Hexacopter&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
				&lt;td&gt;The large payload carrier which hovers our landing platform and swapping system. It runs iNavigation firmware on an SPF3 Mini flight controller and can autonomously loiter.&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;/tr&gt;
			&lt;tr&gt;
				&lt;td nowrap=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Battery case and interface&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
				&lt;td&gt;A hobbyist LiPo battery fits inside a case which exposes its power leads on flat copper plates. This case slides into the quadcopter interface which powers the drone from the battery via spring loaded contacts. The battery is locked inside the interface during quadcopter flight by an interference joint.&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;/tr&gt;
			&lt;tr&gt;
				&lt;td nowrap=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Landing platform&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
				&lt;td&gt;The laser cut wooden platform which rests on top of the hexacopter and the “megaphone” cones which guide the quadcopter into the correct position every time it lands.&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;/tr&gt;
			&lt;tr&gt;
				&lt;td nowrap=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Linear slide rig&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
				&lt;td&gt;Consisting of chrome rods, linear bearings, a stepper motor and battery carriage, this automated system carries out the battery swap. An Arduino controls the rig and end stop switches placed in the 3D printed mounts for the chrome rods allow us to calibrate the motion of the carriage before every swap.&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;/tr&gt;
		&lt;/tbody&gt;
	&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;challenges&quot;&gt;Challenges&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;battery-case-and-latch-mechanism&quot;&gt;Battery case and latch mechanism&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image right&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/hotswap/batt.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main challenge here was finding the right balance between simplicity (minimal motors) and the security of the locking mechanism during flight. We solved this with an interference joint on our battery case to lock it perfectly in place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;swapping-mechanism&quot;&gt;Swapping mechanism&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We use a linear sliding rail to push out the old battery case and simultaneously slide in a new one. This requires only one stepper motor and 2 limit switches for precision alignment. The automation of the swapping is handled by an Arduino Uno. One current limitation of the approach is not being able to perform more than one battery hotswap for a single flight of the hex. We considered designing battery magazines that carry many batteries at once but decided to skip this feature for our proof of concept.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;landing-guidance-system&quot;&gt;Landing guidance system&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We initially designed an autonomous guidance system using OpenCV SURF Feature detection, but then transitioned to supporting hardware guidance to allow for manual landing. The “megaphone” scoops allows for easier precision landing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;electronics&quot;&gt;Electronics&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To facilitate a reliable battery connection, we used copper plates on the battery case as an interface to the battery itself. The battery interface on the quadcopter has 4 10-prong spring loaded contact pins for dynamically adjusting to the location and height of each copper plate on the battery case. These are then directly wired to the quad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;design-approach&quot;&gt;Design Approach&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The system was designed with a bottom up strategy in which each independent system (i.e. hex, quad, linear slider) was designed independently while maintaining an overall grasp on the the final goal. Components that interface with two or more subsystems were designed in the full assembly. The main goal of the project was a successful battery swap, which is mostly a mechatronics design problem. We found design inspiration for the critical mechanisms from plastic buckles to hair clips to leaf springs. Throughout the development process, constant attention was given to designing parts and systems that could utilize rapid prototyping techniques and facilities on campus. All CAD was done through Autodesk Fusion 360 using multiple assemblies to produce complex systems to ideate and develop unique solutions to the problems at hand. All parts that were fabricated with off the shelf parts were transferred by hand into Fusion to streamline the design process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image main&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/hotswap/linear_slider.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;prototyping&quot;&gt;Prototyping&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image left&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/hotswap/cases.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iterating on each design was done through rapid prototyping techniques including 3D printing, laser cutting, and waterjet cutting. 3D printing was used throughout the build for custom parts with a more complex geometry. The vast majority of prints were completed on desktop FDM printers including Type As and Printrbots. The battery cases and interference joints required higher dimensional accuracy, those were printed from ABS on a Stratasys Fortus printer. 3D printing can be difficult to use, has inherent flaws, and publicly available desktop FDM machines on campus fail frequently. Though these machines can be frustrating, the frequency with which they allowed us to iterate on parts with complex 3D geometry was a huge asset to our project and the progress of our mechanical design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;project-poster&quot;&gt;Project Poster&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To finish off the project, the team and I designed this poster to hang in the UAV lab on campus. We’ll display the project to hopefully inspire future generations of UAVs@Berkeley students to try something equally ambitious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image main&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/hotswap/poster.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took Design Innovation 22 in the Fall of my sophomore year. I thoroughly enjoyed it and gained a lot of exposure to modern CNC fabrication methodologies. Design and analysis is much more rewarding when you actually build the thing you designed and analyzed. For my final project in the class, my lab partner Kireet and I built a custom quadcopter frame and our own RC transmitter to control it. The STM F3-based flight controller on board the quadcopter is running an opensource firmware called &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/betaflight/betaflight&quot;&gt;Betaflight&lt;/a&gt;. The receiver and transmitter are implemented with Arduino microcontrollers and 2.4Ghz RF modules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A quadcopter along with a remote control, using two gimbal joysticks, two transceiver modules, an Arduino Uno, and an Arduino Nano. The radio control was implemented in house, we receive 2-axis potentiometer values from the gimbals, transmit them, map them to PWM microsecond values, and generate a PPM signal to send to the flight controller. Both the remote control and the quad include laser cut plates separated by aluminum stand offs and 3D printed component mounting pieces. The quadcopter also features a small first-person view camera that transmits a live analog video feed to a monitor allowing the quad to be piloted without line of sight. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/treyfortmuller/Drone-Rx-Tx&quot;&gt;Here’s&lt;/a&gt; the GitHub repo for the project, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://devpost.com/software/drone-transmitter&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; is the original DevPost for the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;week-2&quot;&gt;Week 2&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First working model of the quadcopter utilizing 2.5” props and two laser cut plates that surround the props to allow for safer indoor flight. This version utilized a proprietary transmitter and receiver (as well as RF protocol) for control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;week-3&quot;&gt;Week 3&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many body options were explored this week, we settled on a wrap of kerfed laser cut wood that we brought to medium fidelity. The addition further protected the motors but required iteration in terms of sizing and fit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image main&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/drone-tx/drone1.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;week-4&quot;&gt;Week 4&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first 3D printable design for a custom transmitter was fabricated as well as a high-fidelity version of the wrap using lighter chipboard that fit the frame properly and was painted red for a finished look. We ended up abandoning the wrap idea when we heavily modified the frame for the final version of our quadcopter for the sake of performance improvements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;week-5&quot;&gt;Week 5&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nearly all the components were included in a CAD model for the final quadcopter and transmitter. The quad received a chassis redesign which is larger allowing for brushless motors with a larger stator to be mounted so that we can swing larger props and thus achieve more thrust, as our intial set up was plagued with weight issues. The new frame design also considered wire routing, and component mounting with more fidelity. The landing gear which straps to the battery was designed and 3D printed on this iteration as well as the “hood” piece which serves as our body, it houses the Arduino Nano, an nRF24 transceiver module, and the FPV camera is perched on top. The transmitter was redesigned to be either more 3D printable or laser cut. We ended up laser cutting the final iteration without losing much of the ergonomics of the device. We also had to design around large gimbal joysticks which are mounted with stand offs on the flanges of the transmitter which gave great control resolution and linearity as compared to previous designs which utilized cheaper game controller type joysticks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the summer of 2015, the summer before my freshmen year at Cal, I decided I wanted to take on a side project. I saw a buddy of mine had built a quadcopter from parts from photos on social media. Upon doing some research I found a large online community of hobbyists and professionals working on opensource hardware and software projects around homebuilt drones. Thousands of hours’ worth of videos and reading material is available on the internet allowing me to muster up enough information to buy parts to put together my first quadcopter running the &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/cleanflight/cleanflight&quot;&gt;Cleanflight&lt;/a&gt; flight control firmware on an STM F1 based flight controller.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After building my first quadcopter, videos started to surface on the internet of FPV (First Person View) flight. Basically, you mount a small camera and a video transmitter (often 5.8Ghz) on board your drone facing forward. Then you receive the video transmission in a pair of video goggles that you wear while piloting the drone. It feels like you’re flying the drone from the cockpit and it allows for much greater maneuverability in flight. I invested in everything I needed to fly FPV and mounted a camera and video transmitter on my drone that same summer. I had an awesome experience, but as soon as I showed up at Cal and met the students at UAVs@Berkeley who were pursuing the same technology, I was hooked. I’ve built many rigs over the past few years I’ve been involved in the hobby, each increasing in craftsmanship, forethought, and number of custom parts (some of which I share on &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.thingiverse.com/tfortmuller/designs&quot;&gt;Thingiverse&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;youtube-channel&quot;&gt;YouTube Channel&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Videos online, as is true with most FPV pilots, got me into the hobby. About a year and a half into my involvement in flying FPV quadcopters, I enjoyed the footage that I produced enough to post to my own YouTube channel. &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdd2_nB8uUar0n4pbsSSuJw&quot;&gt;Here’s&lt;/a&gt; the link, I call the channel “Get Inverted FPV.” Here’s a recent freestyle video:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;

		&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/uR2xS1kjnU0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; gesture=&quot;media&quot; allow=&quot;encrypted-media&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;first-build&quot;&gt;First Build&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the only picture I have of that first-ever quadcopter. I didn’t know what I was doing, so I bought this ridiculous frame with inverted rear motors. It’s underpowered, takes up too much space, and the power distribution board was a nonstandard size, so I had to mount above the top plate. It took me about 2 weeks to build and I was pleasantly surprised when it flew.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image main&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/fpv/fpv2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;zmr250-build&quot;&gt;ZMR250 Build&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first quad I built at Cal, in my dorm room. I learned to fly in “rate mode” on this aircraft. Flying in rate mode means the pilot directly controls the angular velocities of the vehicle about each axis, rather than on board software leveling the quadcopter automatically. Transitioning from piloting an off-the-shelf drone (which employs a large sensor array and software stack to stabilize itself) to piloting a custom-built rig in rate mode is akin to stepping out of a Honda Civic and into a Formula One racercar. It’s difficult to learn, and there were many crashes throughout the process, but it allows for full control in acrobatic flight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image main&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/fpv/fpv3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;zmr250-build-v2&quot;&gt;ZMR250 Build V2&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The frame is a very similar geometry from the previous build, but this frame has real 3K carbon twill. The build went through many iterations as I experimented with my first custom 3D printed parts (all PLA) for mounting components and cleaning up the build. This thing was continuously evolving, my go-to build for over a year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image main&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/fpv/fpv4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;image main&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/fpv/fpv5.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;image main&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/fpv/fpv6.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;image main&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/fpv/fpv7.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;qav210-build&quot;&gt;QAV210 Build&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used a knockoff QAV210 Frame for this build. Here I experienced some unwanted gyro noise propagating from the motors, the Chinese carbon wasn’t rigid enough. Although I liked the compact form factor, I quickly retired the frame.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image main&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/fpv/fpv8.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;connex-build&quot;&gt;Connex Build&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Drone Worlds Expo in San Jose in the Fall of my sophomore year, I talked to an engineer from Amimon, the manufacturer of a digital video transmitter and receiver. Rather than the analog 5.8Ghz video feed which some suffers from low resolution, noise, etc. this product offers 1080p live video with (supposed) latency on the order of an analog feed. The whole system costs over $1,300, and somehow, I talked myself onto the beta testing list for the product, and they ended up letting me keep it! I was the only beta tester looking to implement this device onto an FPV racing rig, the main demographic was cinematographers. I printed custom mounts for the massive patch antennas. and built everything on a QAV250 with arm extensions and top plate which fits the GoPro in-line with the main body of the frame. The video feed was impressive, but I was so scared of crashing this thing with so much money on board, the build wasn’t nearly as fun to fly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image main&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/fpv/connex.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;hmb-x5-build&quot;&gt;HMB-X5 Build&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My main rig for the past year. Carries a GoPro Hero5 Session. A custom top plate, FPV cam mount, GoPro mount, and SMA antenna mount. The antenna mount is printed in flexible TPU so the joint simply bends rather than solder pads being ripped out. It’s the most robust quad I’ve ever built, it’s got loads of power and produces smooth footage. At one point I even had two identical copies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image main&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/fpv/hmb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;image main&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/fpv/fpv15.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;3inch-build&quot;&gt;3inch Build&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I experimented with a micro setup for the first time here. The main design criterion was to get an all-up weight of less than 250g, so the FAA (and UC Berkeley) considers it a toy. It runs 4S just like all my other racers and its got some kick. The frame is the main plate from an iFlight iX3, and I built it first as an under-slung battery build, then as a low profile top mounted build. I designed the AIO cam mount, the bottom plate, and a battery pad which traces the geometry of the frame and printed them. The bottom plate is PLA and everything else is TPU. Better yet, I traced the frame so it’s all in CAD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image main&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/fpv/three.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;image main&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/fpv/fpv20.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;los-build&quot;&gt;LOS Build&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you might imagine, I’ve got a stock pile of spare parts that frightens most everybody that walks into my apartment. I put some of those spares to good use and built up a line of sight quad (no FPV) for practicing some LOS handling. I figure it’s better to have a flying robot than parts for a flying robot. The vehicle is extremely light, built from the HMB-X5 high density rubber frame. I designed the open “pod” and printed it from TPU for protection.&lt;/p&gt;
