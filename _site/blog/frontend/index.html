<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Some stuff about not caring about web development, but wanting a web presence</li>
  <li>Stuff that is important:
    <ul>
      <li>look good (im not a design expert)</li>
      <li>easily maintained, expanded, redeployed</li>
      <li>As cheap as possible</li>
      <li>Responsive</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Ran into Jekyll and some tutorials on YouTube. Why is Jekyll Cool</li>
  <li>Bit of story, started developing my website (became fluent with Jekyll’s workflow and the hardest part of webdev now is writing the content, as it should be). Got so comfortable that I volunteered to take over websites for some of the organizations I’m a part of at UC Berkeley…</li>
</ul>

<p>Below is the delta wing I purchased, it’s made from a <a href="https://www.flitetest.com/articles/ft-mighty-mini-arrow-build">Flite Test Arrow</a> airframe and various off the shelf electronics. It was equipped with a live first-person-view (FPV) analog video feed transmitted over 5.8Ghz and a FrSky frequency hopping receiver at 2.4Ghz. This vehicle had no flight controller onboard, the receiver was connected straight to the servos and electronic speed controller. That means I was in full control of the vehicle with the sticks on my transmitter correlating to angular velocity about each axis.</p>

<p><span class="image main"><img src="/images/wing/intro/1_first_build.jpg" alt=""></span></p>

<p>Given my experience with racing quadcopters, I expected to at least be able to bring the plane safely back to the ground after I launched it. During the maiden flight I crashed it and destroyed the center pod. Thankfully, no electronics took any damage, and the wings maintained their integrity. I removed all the undamaged components from the wreckage and disposed of the center pod. I left the field that day humbled, but at least I had the opportunity to be creative with my repairs.</p>

<p>The standard Flite Test airframe is made out of folded foam board held together with hot glue. I decided to increase my chances of surviving a few more crashes in the next iteration of the build by replacing the center pod with laser-cut 1/8th-inch thick plywood. I designed the center pod to be wider than the stock version to improve serviceability and leave room for a flight controller in the future. The new pod consists of a top plate that extends to the nose, two side panels with mounting holes for antenna and M3 hardware, a bottom plate with slots for velcro-strapping a battery, and a back plate with mounting holes for a brushless motor. All the pieces would be secured together along their edges with tongue joints and wood glue. I designed the new pod in Autodesk’s Fusion 360 CAD tool, then exported a DXF to Adobe Illustrator for laser cutting. Below is the design file in Illustrator, the parts cut on the bed of the laser cutter, and the cleaned up parts ready for gluing. The original winglets for the wing were damaged in the crash, so I designed and cut some new ones from the same material.</p>

<p>A popular wood working technique for bending wood is called “kerfing.” Essentially one makes many small parallel cuts to allow the wood to become a shapable, living hinge. This technique becomes extremely easy to execute with accuracy when a laser-cutter is available. I included a kerfed edge along the nose of the center pod I designed to give the front-end a rounded edge similar to the stock design. The kerfed section also serves as a living hinge to open the top of the pod for battery replacement or access to the electronics. There’s a horseshoe-shaped gap towards the bottom of the kerfed section for an FPV camera to have a front facing view, but remain protected from head-on impacts. I can’t speak to the aerodynamics of the nose of the aircraft, but I was very happy with the aesthetics and hinge functionality. Below is one of the repaired wings which needed some slight modifications on the belt sander, the glued center pod ready for install, and the wings secured to the new center pod on the work bench.</p>
