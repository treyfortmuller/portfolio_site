#### Introduction

<span class="image left"><img src="{{ "/images/drums.jpg" | absolute_url }}" alt="" /></span>

My name is Trey Fortmuller, I'm originally from sunny Newport Beach, CA. Now I'm based in the bay area as a junior <a href="http://engineeringscience.berkeley.edu/engineering-physics/">Engineering Physics</a> major at UC Berkeley. Engineering Physics is kind of like "applied physics" at other schools, but it's in the College of Engineering at Cal. I chose it for its flexibility, students in the program can choose their upper division classes to gear themselves for graduate programs in physics or engineering, or to join the workforce right after undergrad. I personally try to take as many robotics and control classes as possible because I'm considering pursuing a masters in the vein of autonomous systems. My major still allows me to take quantum mechanics and electromagnetism with the physics majors simply because those topics scratch an intellectual curiosity of mine. I've done research in Professor Pieter Abbeel's Robot Learning Lab on campus at Cal, I've interned in the closures team at Faraday Future working on computer vision applications, now I'm searching for exciting Summer 2018 opportunities. 

#### Interests

Outside of class, I like to ride my road bike. I've been on a bike since I was in 8th grade, and I raced throughout high school on a team based in Irvine, CA. Now I ride in the hills of Berkeley with <a href="https://cycling.berkeley.edu/">Cal Cycling</a>. 

I've been playing the drums since as long as I can remember. I was lucky enough to have the opportunity to study privately with some incredible professionals in orange county from the time I was in 6th grade through my senior year in high school. I played snare drum in my high school's drumline, and drumset in the jazz band. While I was in high school I also marched two year of drum corps with the <a href="http://www.impulseyoutharts.org/">Impulse Drum and Bugle Corps</a> on snare drum. Since arriving at Cal I've been playing the <a href="https://ucjazz.berkeley.edu/">UC Jazz Ensembles</a>. I've met some of my best friends through this program and have been able to continue to grow as a musician despite demanding coursework each semester. I've also got a band outside of UC Jazz, called the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/typicalcows/">Typical Cows</a>. We play jazz, funk, and fusion type stuff, check out our YouTube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXxrpCfCHCs">here</a>.

Lastly, I lead an engineering student organization on campus at UC Berkeley called <a href="https://uav.berkeley.edu/">UAVs@Berkeley</a> (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles at Berkeley). We design, build, and test novel projects in the area of aerial robotics every semester. Its a student organization of about 60-80 active members. I got involved my freshmen year at Cal while I was pursing a quadcopter build as a personal project. I fell in love with the people, the technology, and the opportunities it gave me to grow as an engineer, a teammate, and a leader. I took over as president of the organization at the start of junior year at Cal and haven't looked back. Now I interface with the administration, work on funding acquisition, and adopt project management roles for all our engineering teams. Here's a picture of me with the rest of the Fall 2017 executive board (from left to right: Andre, Ryan, myself, and David).

#### The Project Portfolio

I built this site to feature some of the exciting projects I've gotten to work on in and out of class. The resources available to an engineering student at Cal are incredible, so you can go a long way with just some time, motivation, and an idea. I also built this website out to exercise some skills in web design and front end development (shouts out to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyIe-61Y8C4_o-zZCtO4ETQ">DevTips</a> for the educational resources). It took me about two weeks to push version 1.0, and the hardest part was gathering my thoughts to write out the project pages. It's built on Jekyll and hosted on gh-pages so it was virtually free, all I paid for was the domain name. I'm happy with how the site turned out and I'll keep it updated as I pursue new projects and improve old ones.
