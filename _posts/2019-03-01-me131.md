# Notes

## Labs

1. Nothing really (using the terminal and stuff)
2. (Simulating Kinematic Models in ROS) ROS intro, Github, integrating a ROS teleoperation node, PID cruise controller in simulation and tested response with the BARC simulator
3. (Introduction to the BARC Vehicle) Sending simple control commands mostly
4. (BARC System Identification) Least squares method and data collection to characterize PWM > accel and PWM > braking and PWM > steering transfer functions
5. (Longitudinal Dynamics: Cruise Control) PI Cruise Controller on the BARC (as opposed to simulation in Lab 2) Simulink experiment for gains via pole placement, then manual tuning on the vehicle
6. (Longitudinal Dynamics: Model-based Cruise Control) Coast down tests to determine Cd and Rx for the BARC (as we did for a simulated vehicle in HW3??) LQR cruise controller design, only done in Simulink experiment, not implemented on the car (**yet?**)
7. (Reconstructing Motion from IMU Data) Use real IMU data off of a car to reconstruct the motion comparing to GPS data as ground truth
8. (Lateral Control: Model-based) Comparing Kinematic Bicycle Model and Dynamic Bicycle Model open-loop predictions of motion given the longitudinal velocity Vx and df the steering input comapred to dGPS data off a real car as ground truth
9. (Implementing Lateral Control: Simulink) ---I'm here now---

# Outline

### Intro to BARC
It's capabilities, sensors, parts, who built it, how do you work with it (embedded linux computer and a ROS based software architecture), BARC github and website, how's I get my hands on one (taking a class in vehicle dynamics and control).

### Parameter Estimation
What paramaters do we need, what experiements can we do to get them, what infrastructure will we use to collect and process data, results from these experiements, might include actuator characterization, then Rx and Cd from the longitudinal model

### Controller Design
Models, simulation (using simulink or the BARC simulator), implementation, performance and results, videos
