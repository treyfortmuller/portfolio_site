## Motivation

I go to school in Berkeley, CA. The campus is built on a hill, so it's difficult to get from point A to point B if point B is East of point A. Electric vehicles are, of course, the future of personal transportation, but I'm on a budget so a Tesla isn't an option. In fact, even a $1,400 Boosted Board is a little pricey. I decided to build my own electric longboard to get around the Berkeley hills, I wanted all the torque I could muster whilst keeping the cost down.

## Drivetrain Specification

I knew I wanted to use two 4S LiPos in series to run my powertrain on 8S power because I can still use 4S batteries for other projects (flying drones, field charging other LiPos, etc.). With 8S voltage decided, what KV motor should I buy and what gear reduction should take place between the motor and the wheels?

Beyond the hills being hard to conquer, the pavement in Berkeley is treacherous. Big wheels make clearing gaps and cracks in the asphalt easier and the largest, easily found longboard wheels are 90mm in diameter. I do value my physical safety, so I decided on a top speed of 20mph. Upon doing some research, I found gear reductions on electric longboards to be anywhere from 1.8 to 2.5, I went with a 3:1 gear reduction to optimize for torque rather than top speed. We do some math to find the required motor KV:

The best brushless outrunner motor candidate I could find was <a target="\_blank" href="https://hobbyking.com/en_us/turnigy-aerodrive-sk3-6374-192kv-brushless-outrunner-motor.html?wrh_pdp=2">this</a> 192KV Turnigy from HobbyKing. It's got some convenient mounting holes and the stator is tall rather than wide, so it should fit nicely under the deck.

## Design

### The Board

<span class="image main"><img src="{{ "/images/e-board/render1.png" | absolute_url }}" alt="" /></span>

I designed the deck itself from scratch. This was an awesome excuse to get my hands dirty with a piece of fabrication equipment I had not gotten to interact with so far, the ShopBot CNC Router. This is an 8-foot by 6-foot behemoth of a CNC machine available to me in Jacobs Hall on campus at UC Berkeley. I modeled the splines of the deck after other off the shelf designs I had seen for longboards. I purchased an 8-foot by 6-foot piece of 3/4inch plywood for the project (it cost me $16) and was able to cut five decks out of it.

My design features a divot in the underside of the deck for low profile mounting of electronics, inset mounting for the trucks, and a filleted underside edge. It took 8 hours to cut all 5 decks using 4 tool changes on the ShopBot. This was also my first experiencing generating gcode for the ShopBot in Autodesk Fusion 360's CAM workspace. The tool path simulations and automatic collision/interference warnings were super useful, and prevented me from destroying a CNC machine worth (much) more than my car. Here's the tool paths outlined in Fusion:

<span class="image right"><img src="{{ "/images/e-board/cover.jpg" | absolute_url }}" alt="" /></span>

I designed and printed some covers which wrap over the divot in four pieces to protect the electronics bay from moisture or gravel. They're prototyped now out of PLA and are meant to be attached simply with M3 flathead screws. I'm brainstorming now how I might fabricate a mechanism to more easily remove and reattach them when I need to access the bay to charge batteries. The final products will be printed out of Nylon for durability.

Longboards are typically made from bamboo, maple, birch, or composite materials. I made mine from a low-grade plywood without paying much attention to the load carrying capacity of my design. Upon hopping on for the first time, I felt an uneasy sinking at the center of the board under my weight rather than the springy feel of manufactured boards. I compensated with an aluminum beam spanning the electronics bay and it felt much safer.

I sourced a few off the shelf parts from <a target="\_blank" href="https://diyelectricskateboard.com/">DIY Electric Skateboard</a> for gears, pulleys, and a motor mount. This simplified the build, but I still had to modify my rear trucks meticulously with a file to mount the motor properly. Using the cast aluminum parts for the critical drivetrain components probably boosts my safety rating a bit.

### The Handheld Remote

<span class="image main"><img src="{{ "/images/e-board/transmit1.jpg" | absolute_url }}" alt="" /></span>

Mechanical design for the hand held remote is underway now. I've got to fit an Arduino Nano, a 9V battery, an nRF24 transceiver module, a dead man's switch, and potentiometer for throttle control inside an ergonomic 3D printed case. I've got the electronics finished and code ready to be tested. 

More to come after I complete this project.
