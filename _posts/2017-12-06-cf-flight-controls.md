## ME136: Introduction to Control of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles
My lab group's controller is available on <a href="https://github.com/treyfortmuller/ME136">my GitHub</a>, along with the full PX4 firmware, ready to be flashed to a Crazyflie.

### Course Description
<div class="box">
  <p>
  	This course introduces students to the control of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The course will cover modeling and dynamics of aerial vehicles, and common control strategies. Laboratory exercises allow students to apply knowledge on a real system, by programming a microcontroller to control a UAV.
