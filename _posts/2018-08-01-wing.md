## Introduction

Something about wanting to get into wings, why are delta wings cool. I'll break this build into several parts.

This is Flite Test Arrow (I think), took this thing and despite my best efforts of scowering YouTube for how to have a successful maiden flight I crashed it and destroyed the pod. No electronics took any damage. The differing flight dynamics experienced by the pilot between multirotors and fixed wings. Took the undamaged wings off and capaitalized on an oppurtunity to be creative with the next build
