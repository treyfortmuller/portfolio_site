  	Abstract - This paper presents a model to predict aerodynamic disturbances during close formation flight of two multirotors. The model is based on a propeller velocity field model and characterization of change in propeller thrust under oncoming flow. Using this model, we predict forces andtorques on one mutirotor due to downwash of the other with respect to relative separation of the multirotors. We conduct proximity flight experiments using two types of quadcopters to measure forces and torques using accelerometer and rategyro. Predictions from the model and results from experiments match well for vertical separations greater than seven times the vehicle size. This verifies the range of fidelity of the model.

	Abstract - Building upon the success of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), California Institute of Technologyâ€™s (Caltech) Innovation to Flight (i2F) 2017 Zephyrus Missions, the i2F team has continued making high-altitude balloon (HAB) flights more affordable, reusable, and easier to perform by users of all HAB experience levels. With the creation of the automatic HAB
	launcher Talos, the i2F team has taken what was once a 15+ person job of launching a 5.44 kg (12 lb) payload via a 3000 g (3
	m diameter at launch) latex HAB and has reduced it to a singleperson task. Furthermore, the time from arrival at the launch
	site to launching a payload via Talos is still under one hour. The
	majority of that time is consumed by the inflation of the balloon. The i2F team has additionally overhauled the Zephyrus avionics
	and communications systems, which are now able to support two-way communications with the ground station while hosting
	several experiments. This is contained within a 1.2U CubeSat form-factor. The team has additionally designed and built two
	antenna tracking units for use during operations. This system can uplink and downlink data at a range tested to 160 km (100
	miles). The 2018 project campaign for the updated Zephyrus flight vehicle, the Talos automatic HAB launcher, and the longrange two-way telemetry system, was constructed and tested within a span of 10 weeks and on a materials budget of less than $10,000.
